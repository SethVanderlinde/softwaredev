    <h1>Smoked Pulled Ham</h1>
    <p>Recipe by: Nicole Johnson</p>
    <p>
        Smoked pulled ham is a rich delicacy that is slow-coocked and smoked into a rich flavorful dish.
        That few people will get the chance to enjoy. This is a long but rewaring process that deserves
        the time and patience needed to make it just right. Try it
        and I promise you won't be disappointed!
